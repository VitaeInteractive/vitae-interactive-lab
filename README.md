# Vitae Interactive Lab

This repository contains prototypes, experiments, and gameplay sandboxes built as part of my journey toward becoming a Technical Designer.

## Purpose
- Explore gameplay feel and systems in isolation
- Test ideas quickly without polish pressure
- Document learning through iteration

## Status
Work in progress. Experiments may be incomplete, messy, or temporary.

This repo exists to show *process*, not perfection.
